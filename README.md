# Team Combinator

## About

I often play pickup volleyball with a group of friends.  We play games to 11 and then switch up the teams with the goal of going through all the combinations.  This is easy to do with 4 or 5 players but quickly gets hard to remember which combinations have already been done.  In the past I'd printed out worksheets for different combinations that had "ABC v DEF" and spaces to fill out who is A, who is B, etc.  But you need to remember to print out and bring the worksheets with you.  Too much work.  So I decided to fix that.

Goals were:

* Should work well on iPhone, with or without connectivity
* Easy to pick how many players are available and assign names
* Keep track of win/loss on a per-player basis (who doesn't like to see some stats?)

So this project is just a web page with some jQuery.  I store state in browser local storage so that it doesn't disappear if you reload the browser.  The [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net) template I started with works great on iPhone.

## Develop

Not much too the development set up.  There's a npm project for ease of use:

```
# install packages
npm install

# start a local webserver
npm run start

# deploy via surge
npm run deploy
```

I've also been using [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) to do all of this in the browser which is nifty.

## Deploy

I used [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh) to quickly and easily deploy to [https://team-combinator.surge.sh/](https://team-combinator.surge.sh/)
